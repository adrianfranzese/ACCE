      <h3 title="Heading 3">About Westgate Park Salt Lake</h3>
      <p title="body paragraph">Once a thriving wetlands with native animals, plants and marine life, <em>Westgate Park</em> has undergone many transformations from the 1930s to mid-80s. In turns a sand mine, airstrip, construction zone, and rubbish tip, it wasn't until 1985 that then Planning Minister Evan Walker drafted a plan to revitalise the Park and create raised viewing areas to look across the lagoons out to the bay. The Park undertook slow regeneration until new plans were proposed by Melbourne's Parks and Waterways in 1996 to open the waterways up to the Yarra and restore the wetlands to re-introduce native plants and species.</p>
      <p title="body paragraph">Local conservation group, <a href="#">Westgate Biodiversity</a> have worked on the Park for the last 18 years, undertaking extensive surveys of flora and fauna in the area, forming wetlands and infrastructure and planting over 20,000 native plants. They maintain the eight sandstone, granite and iron bark sculptures installed in the Park by artist Lyn Moore in 1990.</p>

      <p title="body paragraph">The famous <a href="#">salt lake</a>, which was formed through severe sand mining in the area in the 1930s, is a seasonal phenomenon, the result of high salt levels, warm temperatures, increased sunlight and lack of rainfall. The algae that grows in the salt crust at the bottom of the lake produces a red pigment as part of its photosynthesis process and in response to the extremely high salt levels. From November to March the lake is usually a vivid shade of pink, fading during autumn and winter with increased rainfall and cooler weather. </p>
